# SpaceShooter

Play this game by cloning it, and opening SpaceShooter/Web_Build/index.html on a web browser. 

The game was made with Unity, from a tutorial. The tutorial provided the models, textures, special FX and sounds. I created the Prefabs, Scene, and Scripts.

Controls: Arrow Keys to move, Spacebar to shoot
